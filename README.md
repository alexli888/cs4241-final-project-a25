# Final Project -  Group 3

For your final project, you'll implement a web application that exhibits understanding of the course materials. This project should provide an opportunity to both be creative and to pursue individual research and learning goals.

### Proposal (Due Tuesday, September 30, 11:59 pm) 
Provide an outline of your project direction and the names of associated team members. The outline should have enough detail so that staff can determine if it meets the minimum expectations or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline. Please include a general description of the project and a list of key technologies/libraries you plan on using (e.g. React, Three.js, Svelte, TypeScript, etc.). Two to four paragraps should provide enough level of detail. Name the file proposal.md and submit a pull request by Tuesday, September 30th at 11:59 PM (end of day). Your pull request does not need to have a specific name. Only one pull request is required per team.



There are no other scheduled checkpoints for your project.
